# GithubProjectRunner
Download or git clone, build and run project on github directly. 
Usually, we look for some open source projects to see if they meet our needs, and manually download the zip file and unzip it, and then open the project, and then build and run it. Ops, it has so many steps. We just want
to run it and preview the effect. This tool just simplifies the steps, it supports some built-in actions(open in explorer, open project or solution, build and run) and custom action which can be bat/cmd file/command or other user-defined executable application. However, it only supports C# project to build and run via code currently.
