# GithubProjectRunner
Download or clone, build and run project on github directly. Usually, we look for some open source projects to see if they meet our needs,
we manually download the zip file and unzip it, and then open the project, and then build and run it. Ops, it has so many steps. We just want
to run it and preview the effect. This tool just simplifies the steps.
